.Dt KHTML_ELEMAT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm khtml_elemat
.Nd get element stack depth of kcgihtml
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgihtml
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.In kcgihtml.h
.Ft size_t
.Fo khtml_elemat
.Fa "const struct khtmlreq *req"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Gets the current depth of the element stack of
.Fa req ,
initialised with
.Xr khtml_open 3 .
This is usually used with
.Xr khtml_closeto 3 .
.Pp
If called before opening any element contexts (i.e., a depth
of zero), a subsequent
.Xr khtml_closeto 3
will close all open scopes.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following outputs a simple HTML page.
It assumes
.Va r
is a
.Vt struct kreq
pointer.
For brevity, it does not do any error checking.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_STATUS],
  "%s", khttps[KHTTP_200]);
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_CONTENT_TYPE],
  "%s", kmimetypes[KMIME_TEXT_HTML]);
khttp_body(r);
khtml_open(&req, r, 0);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_DOCTYPE);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_HTML);
pos = khtml_elemat(&req); /* save at html */
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_HEAD);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_TITLE);
khtml_puts(&req, "Hello, world.");
khtml_closeto(&req, pos); /* to html */
khtml_closeelem(&req, 1); /* head */
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_BODY);
khtml_puts(&req, "Hello, world");
khtml_close(&req);

.Sh CAVEATS
If called in a scope that's subsequently closed, then a new scope
reopened and filled in, a corresponding
.Xr khtml_closeto 3
will unwind the stack to the new scope.
In other words this does not identify a savepoint: it's merely the scope
depth.
