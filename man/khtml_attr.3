.Dt KHTML_ATTR 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm khtml_attr ,
.Nm khtml_attrx
.Nd open an element scope for kcgihtml
.Sh LIBRARY
.Lb libkcgihtml
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In stdarg.h
.In stdint.h
.In kcgi.h
.In kcgihtml.h
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo khtml_attr
.Fa "struct khtmlreq *req"
.Fa "enum kelem elem"
.Fa "..."
.Fc
.Ft enum kcgi_err
.Fo khtml_attrx
.Fa "struct khtmlreq *req"
.Fa "enum kelem elem"
.Fa "..."
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Open a new scope of element
.Fa elem
on the current element stack of
.Fa req ,
initialised with
.Xr khtml_open 3 .
Scopes are closed with
.Xr khtml_closeelem 3 ,
.Xr khtml_closeto 3 ,
or
.Xr khtml_close 3 .
If
.Fa elem
is a
.Qq void
eleemnt
.Pq self-closing, like Dv KELEM_LINK
or
.Dv KELEM_DOCTYPE ,
the scope is immediately closed so no new scope is opened.
.Pp
For
.Fn khtml_attr ,
variable arguments are in pairs, with the first of a pair being a
.Vt "enum attr"
of the attribute type and the second being a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
string.
.Pp
For
.Fn khtml_attrx ,
variable arguments are in triplets: the first is a
.Vt "enum attr"
of the attribute type, the second is a
.Vt "enum attrx"
describing the data format of the third type, and the third type is
either an
.Vt int64_t ,
.Vt char * ,
or
.Vt double
for
.Dv KATTRX_INT ,
.Dv KATTRX_STRING ,
or
.Dv KATTRX_DOUBLE ,
respectively.
.Pp
In both cases, string content is HTML escaped, for example, the
double-quote character is rendered as
.Qq &quot; .
This prevents arguments from
.Qq breaking
the attribute string context.
.Pp
The variable arguments terminated with a singular
.Dv KATTR__MAX .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Returns an
.Ft enum kcgi_err
indicating the error state.
.Bl -tag -width -Ds
.It Dv KCGI_OK
Success (not an error).
.It Dv KCGI_ENOMEM
Internal memory allocation failure, including reaching the maximum
number of possible HTML scopes.
.It Dv KCGI_HUP
The output connection has been terminated.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_FORM
The connection is still expecting headers with
.Xr khttp_head 3 .
Indicates that
.Xr khttp_body 3
did not return with success or was not invoked.
For FastCGI connections, the current connection should be released with
.Xr khttp_free 3
and parse loop reentered.
.It Dv KCGI_SYSTEM
Internal system error writing to the output stream.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following outputs a simple HTML page.
It assumes
.Va r
is a
.Vt struct kreq
pointer.
For brevity, it does not do any error checking.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_STATUS],
  "%s", khttps[KHTTP_200]);
khttp_head(r, kresps[KRESP_CONTENT_TYPE],
  "%s", kmimetypes[KMIME_TEXT_HTML]);
khttp_body(r);
khtml_open(&req, r, 0);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_DOCTYPE);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_HTML);
khtml_elem(&req, KELEM_HEAD);
khtml_attr(req, KELEM_META,
  KATTR_CHARSET, "utf-8", KATTR__MAX);
khtml_attrx(req, KELEM_LINK,
  KATTR_REL, KATTRX_STRING, "stylesheet",
  KATTR_HREF, KATTRX_STRING, "style.css",
  KATTR__MAX);
khtml_close(&req);
.Ed
.Pp
The latter invocation could just as easily use
.Fn khtml_attr .
